# Markup File Generator

Generate a markup file using handlebar templating and json data

```

## Development

Once you've installed, you can simply run:

```bash
$ nodemon 
Or 
$ npm start 
```
View on http://localhost:3010

This starts a local webserver that will automatically reload your changes.

you may need to restart the local server if nodemon doesn't detect the change.
